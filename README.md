I'll include the address of the smart contract once its final version has been deployed. I'll also include the application binary interface (ABI) as well. Both of these will be necessary in order for the mobile devices to interact with the smart contract. Since the smart contract is still under development, these are still subject to change regularly, so I'm not including them for now.
